For the front end of the Ruby on Rails app, I used HTML (HAML), CSS (SASS) and Javascript (jQuery) to make the app responsive and fit the design spec provided. During the application redesign work, I learned a lot about Google Material Design design principles and how views are constructed in Rails.
