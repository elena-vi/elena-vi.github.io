### Experience:

#### Developer, vInspired — Mar 2017 - Present 
Visnpired is a charity which helps young people find volunteering opportunities. My responsibilities here are developing new features on the Ruby on Rails platform and reducing technical debt by refactoring and simplifying layers of unnecessary complexion which was left behind by numerous agencies; actively participating in sprint planning sessions and mentoring apprentice developers. Furthermore getting involved in user testing and user journey mapping, this has helped me build an understand why certain UX decisions are made.

#### Front End Developer, Career Interactive — Aug 2016 - Mar 2017
Career Interactive is the UK's Leading Career Coaching Provider for International Students. My responsibilities at CIUK included: building and maintaining the front end of the coaching platform - this involves using pure vanilla ES6 JavaScript; maintaining and improving the company's website which was built using Django web framework and Wagtail content management system; also assisting in finding solutions for the API design which would allow the old Ruby on Rails application with the newly designed Go application.

#### Junior Developer, Tibit — Nov 2014 - Jun 2016
Tibit is a fin-tech startup based in South London; they provide an attractive solution to the micropayment issue by providing a service which allows users to reward content creators frictionlessly or donate to charity in two clicks. I started working at Tibit as an apprentice developer and got promoted to the role of a junior developer, primarily working on refactoring the front end of the Ruby on Rails payment app. I was responsible for the company site and remodelling the front end of a ruby on rails app. The company site was built using WordPress; I used CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) to tailor the chosen WordPress theme to fit the provided design spec. For the front end of the ruby on rails app, I used HTML (HAML), CSS (SASS) and Javascript (jQuery) to make the app responsive and fit the design spec provided. During the application redesign work, I learned a lot about Google Material Design design principles and how views are constructed in Rails.

#### Intern Developer, Eripple — Feb 2014
eRipple is a startup which redefines mentorship by providing a social network- like environment for entrepreneurs which enables them to find the right experts for their business. In the early stages of the eRipple, I was responsible for creating the company landing page which advertised and explained the business. I used pure HTML and CSS to achieve this.

### Hobbies and Interests

I highly support the open source community, for the last three years I have been volunteering at Mozilla Festival, which happens every year over a period of three days: where loads of open source projects hold workshops showcasing their products and holding talks about various tech and social topics.

In my free time, I enjoy fishing and gardening, along with getting involved with the league of legends community, by participating in tournaments and meet-ups. Also, I like to support new and upcoming music bands by attending concerts and album launches.
