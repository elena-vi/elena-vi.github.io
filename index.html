I started working at Tibit as an apprentice developer and got promoted to the role of a junior developer, primarily working on refactoring the front end of the Ruby on Rails payment app. I was responsible for the company site and remodelling the front end of a ruby on rails app. The company site was built using WordPress; I used CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) to tailor the chosen WordPress theme to fit the provided design spec. For the front end of the ruby on rails app, I used HTML (HAML), CSS (SASS) and Javascript (jQuery) to make the app responsive and fit the design spec provided. During the application redesign work, I learned a lot about Google Material Design design principles and how views are constructed in Rails.
