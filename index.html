		<strong><a href="https://tibit.com/" target="_new">Tibit</a></strong> is a fin-tech startup based in South London; they provide an attractive solution to the micropayment issue by o ering a service which allows users to reward content creators frictionlessly or donate to charity in two clicks. I started working at Tibit as an apprentice developer and got promoted to the role of a junior developer, primarily working on refactoring the front end of the Ruby on Rails payment app. I was responsible for the company site and remodelling the front end of a ruby on rails app. The company site was built using WordPress; I used CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) to tailor the chose WordPress theme to fit the provided design spec. For the front end of the ruby on rails app, I used HTML (HAML), CSS (SASS) and Javascript (jQuery) to make the app responsive and fit the design spec provided. During the application redesign work, I learned a lot about Google Material Design design principles and how views are constructed in Rails.

	<strong><a href="http://www.eripple.co/" target="_new">eRipple</a></strong> is a startup which redefines mentorship by providing a social network- like environment for entrepreneurs which enables them to find the right experts for their business. In the early stages of the eRipple, I was responsible for creating the company landing page which advertised and explained the business. I used pure HTML and CSS to achieve this.

<h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
<p class="justify">
	In my free time, I enjoy fishing and gardening, along with getting involved with the league of legends community, by participating in tournaments and meet- ups. I highly support the open source community, by volunteering at the Mozilla Festival, which happens every year over a period of three days, where loads of open source projects hold workshops showcasing their products and holding talks about various tech and social topics. Also, I like to support new and upcoming music bands by attending concerts and album launches.
